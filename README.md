# 🧠 DetectGPT News Article Analysis Pipeline

This project is an end-to-end pipeline that scrapes news articles from **Aftonbladet.se**, decrypts their encoded article IDs, extracts full article text, and uses a modified version of **DetectGPT** to determine whether each article was written by a human or AI.

Want the data?
If you want the data from Aftonbladet 6.6k articles tested around 6.6 million symbols contact me on ls224ec@student.lnu.se, I also have grafs and exel doc.

## 
> _"Is this news article AI-generated?"_

It does so by:
1. **Scraping encrypted article links**
2. **Decrypting Base62 IDs to Base10**
3. **Fetching full article text from each link**
4. **Running the text through a local AI model (`DetectGPT`)**
5. **Returning a verdict and probability score**

## 🧩 Project Structure

```bash
📁 DetectGPT/
├── batchProcess.js        # Orchestrates scraping & AI detection for all URLs
├── server.js              # Node.js Express server with API endpoints
├── scraper.js             # Scrapes article IDs from Aftonbladet
├── scrape.txt             # Stores raw article URLs
├── ai_results.json        # Output file with AI/human verdicts
├── detect_wrapper.py      # Python interface between Node.js and DetectGPT
├── local_infer.py         # Initializes the model once for reuse
├── model.py               # Main DetectGPT scoring logic (GPT2 + T5)
└── venv/                  # Python virtual environment (HuggingFace, torch, etc.)


✅ Example Output
{
  "url": "https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/Rr77qd",
